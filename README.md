# Portfolio-Website

A portfolio website is a unique way to showcase my work and let others know about me. It's like an evergreen platform for my projects, case studies, and information about me. In addition, it's one of the best ways to express my personality, experience, and capabilities.

I built this website in a week using NodeJs, React, and Firebase as database with beautiful UI/UX. I have used frameworks like tailwind CSS for easy and quick building of the front-end.
